# To-do List
This is the first project I have uploaded to github. It is a simple to-do list created using Java and JavaFX for the user interface. The application is relatively simple in the functions provided, of which these include:
* Adding a new task to the list
* Removing a task from the list
* Marking a task as complete (as well as uncomplete)
* The text files read/saved have a specific pattern (`task` `boolean`)
  * Reading a text file from a given path
  * Saving to a text file with a given path (a text file is created if it does not exist)

## Possible Improvements
Some improvements which could be added to the program to improve its overall usability and add functionality:
* The option to remember a default path to a text file and displaying this list when opening the program
* Remembering previous paths to files
* Improving the look of the UI to make it more modern
* Incorporating deadlines for tasks
* Instead of opening a dialog for adding a task, the user should be able to click the list and start typing
* Include stylization options for text such as bold, italic and colour
